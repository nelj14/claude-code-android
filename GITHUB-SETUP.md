# 🚀 GitHub Actions APK Build Setup

Your project is **ready to go**! Follow these steps to get your APK built automatically.

## 📋 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Name it: `claude-code-android` 
4. Make it **Public** (for free Actions)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code
Copy and run these commands in Termux:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-android.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Watch the Magic! ✨
- GitHub Actions will automatically start building
- Go to your repo → "Actions" tab
- Watch the build progress
- APK will be available in "Artifacts" when done

## 🔧 What Happens Automatically

The GitHub Action will:
1. **Set up** Ubuntu build environment
2. **Install** Node.js, Java, Android SDK
3. **Build** your APK using Capacitor
4. **Upload** the APK as downloadable artifact

## 📱 Download Your APK

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click on the latest workflow run
4. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
5. Download `claude-code-debug.apk`
6. Install on your Android device!

## 🛠️ Next Steps After Build

1. **Test** the APK on your device
2. **Customize** the terminal interface in `www/index.html`
3. **Add** real Claude Code integration
4. **Create** release builds for distribution

## 🔒 Security Note

Your `configuration/settings.json` is not included in git (it's in .gitignore).
For the APK to work with Claude, you'll need to integrate the authentication differently.
